Open the terminal in this directory and run:

```
$ docker-compose build

## How to start coding
This repository is ready to code in VSCode with ObjectScript plugin.
Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) and [ObjectScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daimor.vscode-objectscript) plugins and open the folder in VSCode.

Right-click on **docker-compose.yml** file and click Compose Restart

Once docker will finish starting procedure and show:

```
Creating objectscript-contest-template_iris_1 ... done
```

Click on the ObjectScript status bar and select Refresh connection in the menu.
Wait for VSCode to make connection and show something like "localhost:32778[IRISAPP] - Connected"

You can start coding after that. Open **ObjectScript.cls** in VSCode, make changes and save - the class will be compiled by IRIS on 'Save'.

## Happy coding!
